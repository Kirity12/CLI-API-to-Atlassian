Write a CLI program with Python to add a card to a trello.com board. This program should take user input
to add a Trello card with labels and a comment to the specified column of board. You may not use an
existing Trello SDK, but other third-party library use is allowed.
Create a local git project and commit your code there. Please include a readme with user instructions and
include what your next development steps would be. To simplify things and avoid creation of any public
git repos, please create a tar.gz archive of your local git repository and send us the tarball, as well as an
estimate of the time spent on this task.
